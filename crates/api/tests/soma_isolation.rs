//! The Soma fence, checked from outside the crate.
//!
//! Soma is a work-in-progress project that is not part of Cortex. The `soma`
//! feature is off by default, and these tests assert what that means at the
//! HTTP boundary: the endpoints are absent, the health report does not describe
//! a subsystem this build does not have, and the `Soma ` authorization scheme
//! is refused rather than misread as a malformed JWT.
//!
//! The whole file is compiled out when the feature is on, because every
//! assertion in it is about the feature being off.
