//! The versioned job handed to a sandbox runner, and the typed refusal it can
//! return instead of running.
//!
//! `ExecutionJob` is the narrowest waist in the system: routing, pricing,
//! receipts, and the router's feedback all join on it. Re-cutting it later is
//! expensive, so it ships **complete** — including the fields nothing reads
//! yet. A field that is not populated is `None`; it is never absent.
//!
//! Two rules are load-bearing and are enforced by the types rather than by
//! convention:
//!
//! - **The backend reports what it actually applied.** [`EffortApplication`] is
//!   not derived from the request; it is written by whichever backend ran, so a
//!   CLI that cannot honour an effort level says [`EffortApplication::Unsupported`]
//!   rather than silently swallowing it. A receipt never claims a setting the
//!   backend did not apply.
//! - **A job that cannot be run safely produces a [`Blocked`], not a fallback.**
//!   There is no path in this module that degrades to a less isolated execution.
//!
//! Effort is fixed for the lifetime of an attempt. Two independent constraints
//! agree on this: effort shapes the rendered prompt, so varying it mid-session
//! discards the provider's cached prefix; and escalation is required to retry
//! with fresh context anyway. Escalation therefore creates a *new attempt* and
//! never mutates a running job.
