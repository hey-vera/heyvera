//! The first [`SandboxRunner`](super::SandboxRunner) implementation: a rootless
//! container, locked down.
//!
//! This is deliberately the *first* implementation and not the intended final
//! one. A container shares the host kernel, so against a kernel exploit it is a
//! resource boundary rather than a security boundary — and the threat model
//! here is model-authored code running next to other customers' source. The
//! job records [`IsolationClass::Container`] for exactly that reason: a receipt
//! must state the boundary that ran, not the one a reader would like to assume.
//!
//! Every constraint below is load-bearing, so none of them are configurable.
