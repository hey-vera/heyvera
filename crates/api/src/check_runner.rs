//! Phase A of the execution substrate: run verification checks in a container
//! the worker cannot reach.
//!
//! Task **V1** of `cortex/plan/VERIFIER.md`, second half. The contract lives in
//! [`cortex_core::verification`]; this is the implementation that makes a
//! verdict mean something.
//!
//! Every constraint below is load-bearing, so none of them are configurable:
//!
//! - **A fresh container per check.** No state survives from the worker, from
//!   another customer, or from a previous attempt.
//! - **`--network none`.** A check that can reach the network can fetch a
//!   passing result.
//! - **The tree is mounted read-only.** A check cannot edit its way to green.
//! - **One writable scratch tmpfs, outside the tree.** See below — this is not
//!   a relaxation of the line above, it is what makes it survivable.
//! - **No *inherited* environment.** Not a filtered environment and not an
//!   empty one: exactly [`SCRATCH_ENV`], a compile-time constant. Nothing is
//!   read from the process environment, so the runner cannot receive provider
//!   keys, Clerk secrets, or the production database path even by accident.
//! - **The image digest is recorded on every execution.** "It passed" is only
//!   reproducible if *where* it passed is pinned.
//!
//! # Why there is a scratch tmpfs (F9)
//!
//! There was not one, and the consequence was that **no check the derivation
//! produces could execute**. `ecosystem:cargo-check` and `ecosystem:cargo-test`
//! write to `target/`; with the tree mounted read-only, the rootfs read-only,
//! and no writable path anywhere in the container, every cargo check failed
//! before compiling a line — and `CheckOutcome::Failed` is a verdict *about the
//! customer's work*. So the verifier's failure mode was to blame the customer
//! for its own missing mount.
//!
//! Nothing caught it because every test of the driver uses a `ScriptedRunner`.
//! The specs were tested, the verdict arithmetic was tested, and the one place
//! a spec becomes a running process had no test at all — the same shape as F0,
//! at a different boundary.
//!
//! The fix keeps the invariant that matters. The *tree* is still read-only, so
//! a check still cannot edit its way to green: the source it grades is the
//! source that was delivered. What it gains is somewhere to put build output,
//! at a path outside the tree, on a tmpfs that dies with the container. A check
//! can write freely to `/scratch` and change nothing about what it is grading.
//!
//! **Known gap, not papered over:** `ecosystem:npm-ci` installs into
//! `node_modules/` *inside* the tree, so a scratch directory does not rescue
//! it. Redirecting npm's install prefix changes resolution semantics, and a
//! writable tree copy would give up the property above. The npm floor is
//! therefore still unexecutable here and is recorded as such rather than
//! silently producing `Failed`.
//!
//! Phase B swaps this for Firecracker-class microVMs behind the same trait,
//! which is a deployment decision rather than a redesign.
