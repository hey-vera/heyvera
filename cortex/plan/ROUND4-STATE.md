# Round 4 adversarial pass — working state

Resume file for the fourth adversarial review of
[HARNESS-EXCELLENCE-PLAN-2026-08.md](HARNESS-EXCELLENCE-PLAN-2026-08.md).
Delete this file when the round is closed out.

**Method:** rounds 1–3 attacked by product area and therefore kept finding the
same *class* of gap. Round 4 attacks along four different axes: adversarial
(what does optimisation pressure do to this design), capability (does the plan
actually beat one model, or only cost less than one), foundation (is the code
under the plan worth building on), and actuarial (does the guarantee survive
contact with customers who select against it).

## Findings, ranked

| # | Finding | Where it lands | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The agent writes the code *and* the tests the verdict is computed from. Frozen specs freeze the argv, not the exam. | Phase 27 | written |
| 2 | Best-of-N racing is a false-accept generator on the hard tail, and Phase 6.7 calls it the risk-free knob. | Phase 27.4 | written |
| 3 | Verifier precision is never measured, and every economic claim in 26 phases depends on it. | Phase 27.3 | written |
| 4 | The plan optimises cheaper-than-one-model; the vision is better-than-any-model. No mechanism raises the ceiling. | Phase 28 | written |
| 5 | Repo comprehension: `crates/context` is real and wired, but degrades **silently**, covers 4 grammars, leaves retrieval/impact off the dispatch path, and keeps nothing between runs. | Phase 29 | written |
| 6 | Nothing evaluates Cortex. Champion/challenger grades routes, not the harness. | Phase 30 | written |
| 7 | Refund-on-failure is an insurance product with no actuarial layer, no right to decline, and no revenue-recognition treatment. | Phase 31 | written |
| 8 | Human review capacity is the binding constraint on delivered value and is unmodelled. | Phase 31.6 | written |
| 9 | No kill switch, no circuit breaker, no compensation for external side effects, no gate on agent-added dependencies. | Phase 32 | written |
| 10 | Foundation score and the remediation the plan does not currently carry. | Phase 33 | written |
