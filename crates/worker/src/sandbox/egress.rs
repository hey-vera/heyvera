//! Provisioning and teardown of the per-attempt egress mediator.
//!
//! The design in one sentence: **the sandbox gets a network with no route off
//! the host, and the mediator is the only thing on it that has one.**
//!
//! That is the whole argument. A task that unsets `HTTPS_PROXY` and opens a raw
//! socket to an allowlisted host's IP address does not get filtered — it gets
//! no route. Enforcement is topology, not configuration, because anything that
//! depends on the task cooperating is not enforcement.
//!
//! Concretely, per attempt:
//!
//! 1. A Docker network created with `internal: true`. Docker installs no
//!    gateway for it, so nothing on it can reach anything off the host.
//! 2. The mediator container, attached to that network *and* to `bridge`. It is
//!    the single dual-homed host.
//! 3. The sandbox container, attached to the internal network and nothing else.
//!
//! Both are named from the attempt and torn down with it. A shared mediator
//! would let one task's allowlist serve another task's traffic; a leaked
//! network is the leftover state that makes reuse a leak.
//!
//! See `docs/adr/ADR-0002-egress-mediation.md`.
