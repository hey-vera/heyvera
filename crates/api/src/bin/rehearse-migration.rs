//! Run this tree's migrations against a copy of a database, and report what
//! moved.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Production sat at `schema_version` 42 while `main` was at 65 — twenty-three
//! migrations, on a live database, one of which (v63) rewrites every historical
//! `succeeded` step to `delivered`. That is a forward-only change to
//! customer-visible history, and there is no way to answer "what will this do"
//! by reading twenty-three functions carefully. The only honest answer comes
//! from running them against the actual rows and counting.
//!
//! So: take a copy, migrate the copy, diff the counts. Never the live file —
//! this refuses to run against anything it was not pointed at explicitly, and
//! it makes its own copy rather than trusting the caller to have made one.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo run -p cortex-api --bin rehearse-migration -- ./cortex-prod-copy.db
//! ```
//!
//! Exit status is 0 only if the migration completed and the schema version
//! afterwards is the one this tree expects. A rehearsal that "mostly worked" is
//! not a rehearsal.
