//! One step, end to end, across the seam where F7 and F8 lived.
//!
//! **This is the test that should have existed before PR C merged.** Everything
//! that failed in wave 4 failed on one side of a boundary while a test asserted
//! on the other:
//!
//! - **F7** — a sandbox test asserted that the configuration requested no
//!   network. Nothing asserted that a step routed to a provider could reach
//!   that provider. Cortex could not execute at all, and every sandbox test
//!   passed.
//! - **F8** — the API asserted it assembled context; the worker asserted it
//!   built a prompt. Nothing asserted the context reached the prompt, and it
//!   did not, for the entire life of the execution path.
//!
//! So this test deliberately spans both crates. It runs the real API, the real
//! scheduler and the real router against a real git repository, takes the
//! `ExecuteStep` frame off the wire, and feeds it to the **real worker code
//! path** — `cortex_worker::executor` — asserting on what the sandbox and the
//! model would actually be handed.
//!
//! What it does not do is spend money. Invoking a provider CLI against a live
//! API needs a credential and produces a bill, so the final link — a real model
//! producing a real diff — is proven separately by
//! `cortex-worker/tests/sandbox_adversarial.rs::egress_the_routed_provider_is_reachable`,
//! which reaches `api.anthropic.com` through the mediator from inside a real
//! sandbox in CI. Between the two, every link in the chain is asserted against
//! something real; neither covers it alone, and this note is here so nobody
//! reads either as covering more than it does.

//
// Everything above this line stops at the point where money starts. It proves
// a step is dispatched, leased, routed, framed and handed to the real worker
// path â€” and then asserts on what *would* be handed to a model rather than on
// what a model did. That was honest and it was not enough: "Cortex can complete
// a task" had never been true of anything.
//
// This section closes it. One task runs the whole chain against a live
// provider: dispatched, leased, sandboxed, egress granted, context framed,
// **model invoked**, diff produced, frozen checks executed, verdict written,
// receipt readable.
//
// # The task is chosen so the verdict cannot be vacuous
//
// A zero-dependency crate whose only test fails, because `add` subtracts. The
// frozen checks are `cargo check --locked` and `cargo test --locked`, derived
// from the manifest by the same code as every other run. So:
//
// - before the model runs, the required check **fails** â€” asserted explicitly
//   below, because a check that would pass anyway grades nothing;
// - after it runs, the verdict is `Verified` only if the model actually
//   changed the code.
//
// Zero dependencies is not a shortcut. It means the checks need no registry, so
// this proves the model path rather than measuring a `cargo fetch`, and it is
// the cheapest real task that still has an executable ground truth. This is a
// proof, not a benchmark.
//
// # The gate is loud in both directions
//
// Unset: a banner on stderr and a skip. Set with anything missing â€” no key, no
// runtime, no image: **panic**. Three times now a check has reported green
// while covering nothing, and a live test that quietly degrades to a pass would
// be the fourth and the worst, because the sentence it licenses is the one the
// whole product rests on.

/// Why this run is not happening, or `None` if it is.
