//! What a step intends to write, and whether two steps can run at once.
//!
//! Today a run without explicit file paths takes a lease on `"."` — the whole
//! repository (`scheduler.rs`, "repo-wide run without explicit file paths").
//! That is correct and maximally pessimistic: `.` overlaps everything, so one
//! such run serialises every other run against the same repo. It is also the
//! common case, because most plans do not enumerate their paths.
//!
//! This module derives a write set from what the plan already knows, so the
//! repo-wide lease becomes the fallback rather than the default, and makes
//! disjointness a property that can be *checked* rather than hoped for.
//!
//! The overlap rule matches `path_keys_overlap` in `crates/api/src/db.rs`
//! exactly — same `.`-dominates-everything, same prefix-with-`/` boundary. Two
//! different answers to "do these paths conflict" is a scheduler that grants a
//! lease the conflict checker would have refused, which is the failure this
//! module must not introduce. See the parity test at the bottom.
//!
