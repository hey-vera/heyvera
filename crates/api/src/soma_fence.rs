//! The fence between Cortex and Soma.
//!
//! Soma is a work-in-progress project. It is not part of Cortex, and until it
//! is, nothing on the Cortex execution path may depend on it. This module is
//! the single place where the two meet: everything Soma contributes to the
//! HTTP surface enters through here, and with the `soma` feature off — the
//! default — what enters is nothing.
//!
//! The rule this enforces, stated once so it can be tested: **with the feature
//! off, no Cortex receipt, routing decision, or ledger row may carry a value
//! that originated in Soma.** See `docs/adr/ADR-0003-soma-feature-fence.md`.
