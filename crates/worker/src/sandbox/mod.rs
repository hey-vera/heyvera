//! The boundary between Cortex and model-authored code.
//!
//! Before this module, provider CLIs ran as host processes: a git worktree was
//! attempted for isolation, and when that attempt failed the agent ran in the
//! caller's directory with the worker's full environment, network, filesystem,
//! and credentials. The isolation was documented as best-effort. This module
//! removes the "best" and the "effort" both.
//!
//! # The contract
//!
//! A [`SandboxRunner`] either returns a running [`SandboxSession`] that
//! satisfies every property below, or it returns [`Blocked`]. There is no third
//! outcome, and in particular there is no degraded one:
//!
//! - **Fresh per task attempt.** No writable state survives an attempt, and no
//!   sandbox is ever reused across tenants. Reuse makes every kernel bug a
//!   cross-customer disclosure and every leftover file a leak.
//! - **Egress denied by default**, opened only by an explicit task-scoped
//!   allowlist. A dependency grant names a package registry, and exactly a
//!   package registry.
//! - **No credentials inside.** Not the customer's, and not Cortex's own — a
//!   sandbox holding a provider key can spend Cortex's money. The environment
//!   is empty rather than filtered, because a filter is a list someone has to
//!   keep correct. Git credentials belong to the runner service, which performs
//!   sanctioned fetch and push on the sandbox's behalf.
//! - **Bounded.** CPU, memory, pids, disk, and wall clock all have values.
//!   Unbounded is not representable.
//! - **Torn down.** Teardown runs on success, on failure, on timeout, and on
//!   panic. A leaked sandbox is a bug, not a race.
//!
//! # Why the trait exists
//!
//! A shared-kernel container is a resource boundary and a convenience boundary.
//! Against a kernel exploit it is not a security boundary, and the threat here
//! is model-authored code running adjacent to other customers' source. The
//! requirement is kernel-level isolation.
//!
//! [`ContainerSandbox`] is therefore the *first* implementation, not the
//! intended final one. The trait is deliberately free of container vocabulary
//! so a microVM implementation replaces it without touching a single caller,
//! and [`IsolationClass`] travels on the job so a receipt states which boundary
//! actually ran rather than leaving a reader to assume the stronger one.
